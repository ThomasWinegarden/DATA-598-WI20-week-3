```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

#no spaces or underscores in chunk ref labels!
```{r, starwars-plot, fig.cap = "A ggplot of starwars stuff"}

library(tidyverse)

starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
ggplot() +
  aes(x = height, y = mass) +
  geom_point()

Here is some inline code `r 1 + 1`

\@ref(fig:starwars-plot)

#knitr from class
```{r starwars-tbl}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  select(name, height, mass, homeworld) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption="A knitr kable table of starwars data")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
